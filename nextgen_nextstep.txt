This is perfect. Based on my analysis of netgen-don-academy.web.app (and its associated content for "NextGen DON Academy"), your site is a professional training platform for Directors of Nursing.

The Strategy: You don't just want a generic "chat bot." You need an Admissions Assistant who can explain your "Foundations of DON Leadership" course, discuss tuition, and book consultation calls.

Here are the specific, ready-to-use prompts you can paste into  Claude Code to build this directly into your existing Firebase project.

Phase 1: The "Brain" (Knowledge Base)
First, we need to create the file that holds your academy's intelligence.

Prompt for Claude:

"Create a new file in the backend folder called academy_data.py. Inside it, create a constant variable SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS containing a detailed system prompt for an AI assistant.

The Persona: You are 'Sarah,' the Admissions Assistant for NextGen DON Academy. You are professional, knowledgeable about nursing leadership, and encouraging.

The Knowledge Base (Include these facts):

Purpose: We train aspiring Directors of Nursing (DONs) for long-term care facilities.

Key Courses: 'Foundations of DON Leadership' (covers emotional intelligence, credibility), 'Staff Development' (retention strategies), and 'Financial Stewardship' (budgeting).

Contact: Phone is (248) 795-9750, Email is info@nextgendonacademy.com.

Goal: Your primary goal is to answer questions and then ask, 'Would you like to schedule a quick 15-minute consultation to see if this program is a good fit?'

Constraint: Keep responses concise (under 2 sentences) for voice conversations."

Phase 2: The Voice Server (The Backend)
Now, we build the engine that handles the calls. Since you are on Firebase, we will use a Cloud Run service (managed via your existing project) because it handles the "WebSockets" required for real-time voice better than standard Functions.

Prompt for Antigravity/Claude:

"I need a Python FastAPI backend to handle real-time voice calls using Twilio and OpenAI.

Task: Create a file main.py with the following:

Dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, requests.

Route 1 (POST /incoming-call): Return TwiML that connects the caller to a Stream at /media-stream.

Route 2 (WebSocket /media-stream):

Accept the WebSocket connection from Twilio.

Open a connection to wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime (model: gpt-4o-realtime-preview).

Send the SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS from academy_data.py as the first session update.

The Loop: Receive audio from Twilio -> Send to OpenAI -> Receive audio from OpenAI -> Play to Twilio.

Tool Calling: Add a tool definition for book_appointment(name, time, phone). If the user wants to book, the AI should call this tool. For now, just print the details to the console log.

Please write the complete code and a Dockerfile to deploy this to Google Cloud Run."

Phase 3: The Text Chat Widget (The Frontend)
Finally, let's put the chat bubble on your website.

Prompt for Antigravity/Claude:

"Act as a React Developer. I need a floating chat widget for my website.

Task: Create a React component ChatWidget.js.

UI: A floating circle icon in the bottom-right. When clicked, it opens a chat window.

Style: Use a professional color scheme (Navy Blue and White) to match the NextGen DON Academy branding.

Logic:

User types a message.

Send POST request to a new endpoint /api/chat (which you should add to main.py).

Display the AI's response.

Backend Update: Update main.py to add the /api/chat endpoint that uses the standard OpenAI chat completion API (not realtime) but uses the same SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS."

How to Deploy 
Once Claude writes the code:

Deploy the Backend: Tell Antigravity: "Deploy this folder to Google Cloud Run named 'don-academy-voice'."

Connect Twilio: Go to your Twilio dashboard and set the "Voice Webhook" to your new Cloud Run URL (e.g., https://don-academy-voice-xyz.a.run.app/incoming-call).

Update Frontend: Import the ChatWidget into your main App.js file on your website and redeploy to Firebase Hosting.

Do you want me to write the "Tool Function" code specifically so it saves appointments directly into your Firebase Firestore database?

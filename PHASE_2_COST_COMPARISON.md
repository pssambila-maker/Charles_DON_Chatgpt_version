## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Is free AI good enough?**
**A:** For testing, absolutely! Gemini Pro is very capable. You can upgrade to GPT-4o later if you need "perfect" responses.

**Q: What if I exceed free limits?**
**A:** Gemini has generous limits (60 requests/minute). For most small sites, you'll stay free. If you exceed, you've already proven demand!

**Q: Can I upgrade later?**
**A:** Yes! Switching from Gemini to GPT-4o takes ~5 minutes (change one line of code).

**Q: Do I need to learn Python?**
**A:** No! Free version uses JavaScript (Firebase Functions) - same language as your current site.

**Q: How do I track if it's working?**
**A:** We'll add Google Analytics events to track: chats started, messages sent, appointments booked.
